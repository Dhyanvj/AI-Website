        <h2>Interesting AI Facts</h2>
        
        <ol class="ai-facts">
            <li><strong>The Term "Artificial Intelligence" Was Coined in 1956:</strong> The term "Artificial Intelligence" was first introduced at the Dartmouth Workshop in 1956, where a group of researchers gathered to discuss the possibility of machines simulating human intelligence.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Can Defeat Human Chess Grandmasters:</strong> In 1997, IBM's Deep Blue defeated world chess champion Garry Kasparov. This marked a significant milestone in AI's ability to outperform human experts in complex games.</li>
            <li><strong>AI-Powered Voice Assistants Understand Natural Language:</strong> Voice assistants like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to understand and respond to human speech. They can answer questions, set reminders, and even tell jokes.</li>
            <li><strong>AI in Healthcare Detects Diseases from Medical Images:</strong> AI algorithms can analyze medical images, such as X-rays and MRIs, to detect diseases like cancer and diabetic retinopathy with high accuracy, aiding early diagnosis.</li>
            <li><strong>Chatbots Use AI to Mimic Human Conversations:</strong> Chatbots use AI and NLP to engage in human-like conversations. They're used for customer support, information retrieval, and even therapy.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Algorithms Power Recommendation Systems:</strong> Recommendation systems, like those used by Netflix and Amazon, use AI to analyze user behavior and preferences, suggesting content or products tailored to each individual.</li>
            <li><strong>Self-Driving Cars Utilize AI and Sensors:</strong> Self-driving cars rely on AI algorithms to process data from sensors, cameras, and Lidar systems to navigate roads, detect obstacles, and make real-time driving decisions.</li>
            <li><strong>AI in Creativity:</strong> AI can compose music, create artworks, and write poetry. For instance, the AI-generated portrait "Edmond de Belamy" was sold at auction for $432,500.</li>
            <li><strong>Deep Learning Powers AI's Success:</strong> Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, uses neural networks to analyze and learn from large datasets. It's behind major advancements in speech recognition, image processing, and more.</li>
            <li><strong>AI Ethics and Bias are Key Concerns:</strong> As AI becomes more integrated into society, concerns about ethics and bias arise. Ensuring fairness, transparency, and accountability in AI decision-making is a challenge.</li>
            <li><strong>AI and Virtual Reality (VR) Collaboration:</strong> AI and VR technologies are being combined to create immersive and intelligent experiences, enhancing gaming, training simulations, and virtual meetings.</li>
            <li><strong>AI in Language Translation:</strong> AI-powered translation tools, like Google Translate, use deep learning to provide accurate translations between languages, breaking down language barriers.</li>
            <li><strong>Robotics and AI:</strong> Robots equipped with AI are being used in various fields, from manufacturing and logistics to healthcare and research.</li>
            <li><strong>AI and Video Games:</strong> AI is used to create intelligent opponents and NPCs (non-playable characters) in video games, providing challenging and realistic gameplay experiences.</li>
            <li><strong>AI in Space Exploration:</strong> AI plays a role in analyzing data from space missions, such as identifying interesting celestial objects or predicting space weather.</li>
