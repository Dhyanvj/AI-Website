            <h3>Historical Evolution</h3>
            <p>The journey of AI dates back to the mid-20th century, when researchers began to envision machines that could mimic human intelligence. Over the years, AI has undergone several phases of development, from early symbolic reasoning systems to the current era of machine learning and deep learning. Pioneering moments include the creation of expert systems, the development of chess-playing computers, and the advent of neural networks.</p>

            <h3>Types of AI</h3>
            <p>AI can be classified into different categories based on its capabilities and functionalities:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Narrow or Weak AI:</strong> This type of AI is designed to excel in a specific task or domain. Examples include virtual personal assistants like Siri or Alexa, which can understand and respond to user commands but lack general human-like intelligence.</li>
                <li><strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI):</strong> AGI refers to AI systems that possess human-like intelligence and the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks. While AGI remains a long-term goal, it has not yet been fully realized.</li>
                <li><strong>Artificial Superintelligence:</strong> This hypothetical level of AI surpasses human intelligence and has the potential to outperform humans in virtually every aspect. It's a topic of speculation and ethical consideration.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>
        
        <div class="section">
            <h3>AI Learning Through Data</h3>
            <p>One of the cornerstones of modern AI is its ability to learn from data. Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning are key techniques that enable AI systems to improve their performance over time. By processing vast amounts of data, these systems can identify patterns, make predictions, and adapt their behavior.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong> ML involves training algorithms to learn from data and improve their performance on a specific task. It includes various approaches like supervised learning, where models learn from labeled examples, and unsupervised learning, which involves finding patterns in unlabeled data.</li>
                <li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> Deep learning utilizes neural networks with multiple layers to process complex data. This technique has been instrumental in achieving remarkable advancements in tasks like image and speech recognition.</li>
